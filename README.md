# Shell Command
Shell Command: A shell command is a text-based instruction given to a command-line interface (CLI) shell to perform a specific task on a computer.
CLI: CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It is a text-based user interface used to interact with software and operating systems. This text is to show if I will see this changes when I view this from git. ( let's see what the "git fetch" does )

The command `pwd` is used to show the current working directory. 
```sh
pwd
```

```html
<html>
    <head></head>

    <body></body>
</html>

```

```python
a = 10
while a < 5:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
```
